# Piano

Virtual piano in which you can set the range of piano notes and play the corresponding note.  
Note that each note is denoted by a number, which ranges from 0 to 88.
Standard C's note number is 60, and the piano is by default set to have the standard range, playing from 60 to 72 (C to B#).

For convenience, you can play the standard notes with KEYS, too.

If Key is...(1), then it plays...(2)
